# Sewing Maya Tool - SMT

## What's SMT?

Retopo & Merge tool made for Marvelous Designer to Maya workflow.

## Why?

I noticed that make the vertices from different pieces in the pattern takes a lot of time and effort to connect manually. That's why I'm making a tool that aligns the vertices to make a clean sew, based in the vertex data extracted from the XML file from Marvelous Designer.

## Development

*Last update: 09/04/23*
I created a curve for each edge to work like a "live surface", making all the vertices moving inside the curve range. Also I'll take one day of the week to clean up the code and organice the files into directories.

### Initial Concept

## TO DO

- [ ] Snap vertices to the edge
- [ ] Make vertex alignment functionality
- [ ] Save / Load pattern data
- [ ] Previs outfit
- [ ] Convert MD vertex data to a more handy variable
