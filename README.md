# Sewing Maya Tool - SMT

## What's SMT?

Retopo & Merge tool made for Marvelous Designer to Maya workflow.

## Why?

I noticed that make the vertices from different pieces in the pattern takes a lot of time and effort to connect manually. That's why I'm making a tool that aligns the vertices to make a clean sew, based in the vertex data extracted from the XML file from Marvelous Designer.

## Development
